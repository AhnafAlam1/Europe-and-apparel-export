If you don't want a title for your legend in ggplot2, you can use the guide_legend function and set the title argument to NULL. Here's how you can modify your code:
m_s |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = share, group = type, color = type)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Percentage of market share (in decimals)") +
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent", labels = c("China", "LDCs")) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))
  
The guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL)) part ensures that the legend title is set to NULL, effectively removing the legend title.

This modification should result in a legend without a title while retaining the color distinctions for the "China" and "LDCs" labels. Adjust as needed based on your specific preferences.

Write more directly and concisely: The European Union implemented the EBA or 'Everything But Arms' initiative in 2001. The scheme provided tariff-and-quota-free access to the European market for 49 of the world's least developed countries (LDCs). The program aimed to demonstrate Europe's commitment to global leadership by boosting development in LDCs through exports [@faber2009everything]. The EBA removed tariffs from imports on all things except arms from LDC countries. EBA has had a positive impact on Asian LDCs [@gradeva2010role], with exports to the EU increasing significantly. In fact, existing literature highlights that all LDCs have benefited from EBA, to some extent. However, current studies fail to show the extent to which Europe has come to rely on LDCs for cheap imports, particularly apparel. This study aims to fill this gap by asking: Do LDCs benefit more from EBA, or does Europe gain more from cheap apparel imports?

European countries rely heavily on apparel imports. In particular, Germany imports 95% of its apparel for consumption, while France, Italy, and Spain import 85%, 65%, and 55% of apparel, respectively [@gereffi2010global]. EBA was initially hailed as a success story. Over time, studies have found that LDCs end up competing with one another for trade contracts, driving down the price of clothing, with EU countries benefiting from it. Furthermore, this scheme has been dubbed as "more political than developmental" in one study [@page2002new]. Europe's preference for importing clothing is evident when the escalation of the Rohingya crisis and deteriorating human rights conditions in Myanmar did not lead to the withdrawal of trade preferences from the country [@pennisi2023everything]. However, this does not necessarily imply that Europe has come to rely on apparel imports, as it could be the case that the European clothing industry simply divested in apparel, hindering LDCs' ability to compete in the European market.

The paper uses graphs and figures to highlight the development in the export industry in LDCs since the advent of EBA and then delves into whether Europe is ultimately the beneficiary of this trade balance. The investigation finds that while it is true that LDCs, in particular, Asian LDCs, have seen increased levels of exports, it fails to conclude whether Europe necessarily relies on them for apparel imports.

The paper starts with a discussion about the datasets that will be used throughout the paper. The following section contains the Results section, which will highlight all the graphs and tables used throughout the paper. Lastly, the Discussion section will contain the lessons that can be learned from this paper and how the findings of the paper translate to the real world. Finally, the paper will end with a Conclusion section and a discussion on the next iteration of the paper.

In 2001, the European Union launched the 'Everything But Arms' (EBA) initiative, granting tariff-and-quota-free access to the European market for 49 of the world's least developed countries (LDCs). The program aimed to showcase Europe's commitment to global leadership by fostering development in LDCs through increased exports [@faber2009everything]. EBA eliminated tariffs on imports from LDCs, excluding arms. Notably, EBA positively impacted Asian LDCs, leading to a significant rise in exports to the EU [@gradeva2010role]. While existing literature acknowledges overall benefits for LDCs, studies fail to quantify Europe's dependence on LDCs for cost-effective imports, especially in apparel. This study addresses this gap by investigating whether LDCs benefit more from EBA or if Europe gains more from cheap apparel imports.

European nations heavily depend on apparel imports; for instance, Germany imports 95% of its apparel, while France, Italy, and Spain import 85%, 65%, and 55%, respectively [@gereffi2010global]. Initially praised as a success, EBA has raised concerns over LDCs competing for trade contracts, leading to decreased clothing prices that benefit EU countries. Some studies label the scheme as "more political than developmental" [@page2002new]. Europe's preference for importing clothing becomes evident as trade preferences with Myanmar remained unaffected despite the Rohingya crisis and deteriorating human rights conditions [@pennisi2023everything]. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate Europe's reliance on apparel imports; it could be the European clothing industry divesting in apparel, hindering LDCs' competitiveness in the European market.

Using graphs and figures, this paper highlights the development in LDCs' export industry since EBA's introduction, examining whether Europe is the ultimate beneficiary of this trade balance. The investigation reveals increased exports for LDCs, especially in Asia; however, it doesn't definitively establish Europe's reliance on them for apparel imports.

The paper initiates with a discussion on the datasets used, followed by the Results section highlighting graphs and tables. The Discussion section delves into lessons learned and real-world implications. Finally, the Conclusion section wraps up the paper with a discussion on the next iteration.

write this more precisely and concisely and get rid of "flowery" tone: Impact of EBA on LDC Exports
@fig-2 is a replication of Figure 1 in the original paper. The figure highlights the evolution of the EBA utilization rate between 2001 and 2018. The utilization rate denotes the fraction of apparel imports from LDCs that entered Europe under the EBA scheme. While data suggests a steady upward trend, utilization increased by 20 percent between 2010 and 2011 [@EU-EXTRA], due to a policy change in EBA relaxing the local fabric requirement for apparel.

China's Dominance in Apparel Exports
@tbl-2 is the summary table for the m_s data set. The data is derived from [@UNComtrade] and focuses on the differences in apparel exports between China and all other LDCs combined. The table highlights significant differences in the apparel export value between China and others, and this diverging trend continues in the market share of apparel exports between LDCs and China.

@fig-1 is a replication of Figure 3 in the original paper, focusing on China's dominance in apparel exports compared to other LDCs. Between 2001 and 2018, China's market share increased by 33 percent, while LDCs experienced smaller percentage gains over the same period. From 3 percent in 2002, LDCs' apparel exports grew to about 8 percent in 2018.

Differences in Export of Woven Materials vs. Knitted Materials
@fig-3 is a replication of Figure 4 in the original paper. The graph features the utilization rate of Bangladeshi apparel exports between 2001 and 2018. The utilization rate, in this context, implies the ratio between the value of imports into the EU under EBA relative to the total apparel imports into the EU from Bangladesh, irrespective of EBA. The framework highlights that the utilization rate for knit apparel has always been near 100 percent; however, there is a shift in the utilization rate of woven apparel, going from roughly 20 percent in 2001 to close to 100 percent by the end of 2018, with a significant jump between 2010 and 2011.

@fig-4 and @fig-5 are extensions of the framework in @fig-3, focusing on Cambodia and Nepal, respectively. The similarities between these nations include close to a 100 percent utilization rate for both woven and knit apparel imports from 2011 onwards. However, Cambodia's utilization of woven material has always been near 100 percent, contrasting with the trend for Bangladesh and Nepal. Nepal and Bangladesh are similar in that both countries see a shift in woven apparel between 2010 and 2011, although in Bangladesh's case, it was more pronounced. Cambodia experiences a shift in knit apparel imports around 2010-11, as opposed to woven apparel.

EBA Impact on LDC Exports:

@fig-2 replicates Figure 1, illustrating the EBA utilization rate's evolution (2001-2018). This rate signifies the proportion of apparel imports from LDCs entering Europe under EBA. Despite a generally increasing trend, a 20% uptick occurred in 2010-2011 [@EU-EXTRA], attributed to EBA policy changes relaxing local fabric requirements.
China's Apparel Export Dominance:

@tbl-2 summarizes the m_s dataset from [@UNComtrade], emphasizing differences in apparel exports between China and all other LDCs. The table underscores substantial disparities in apparel export values, persisting in the market share of exports between LDCs and China.
China's Dominance in Apparel Exports:

@fig-1, a reproduction of Figure 3, focuses on China's ascendancy in apparel exports versus other LDCs (2001-2018). China's market share surged by 33%, contrasting with smaller gains by LDCs (from 3% in 2002 to around 8% in 2018).
Export Disparities: Woven vs. Knitted Materials:

@fig-3, replicating Figure 4, depicts Bangladeshi apparel export utilization rates (2001-2018). The rate represents the ratio of EU imports under EBA to total EU imports from Bangladesh, irrespective of EBA. While knit apparel maintains a near 100% utilization rate, woven apparel saw a shift from roughly 20% in 2001 to nearly 100% by end-2018, with a notable increase in 2010-2011.
Woven and Knit Apparel Trends in Cambodia and Nepal:

@fig-4 and @fig-5 extend the framework in @fig-3, focusing on Cambodia and Nepal, respectively. Similarities include close to 100% utilization rates for both woven and knit apparel imports from 2011 onwards. Contrasting trends are evident, such as Cambodia consistently maintaining near-100% utilization for woven material, unlike Bangladesh and Nepal. Nepal and Bangladesh share a shift in woven apparel around 2010-2011, more pronounced in Bangladesh, while Cambodia experiences a shift in knit apparel imports around 2010-11.
